<p>Software as a Service is a method by which software licences are provided to customers as a service for a period of time, usually a year, rather than an outright perpetual purchase. The key value provided by SaaS is that it lowers the annual cost of a licence and ensures that every year one has the latest version of software at their fingertips.</p>

<p>Ideabytes½á¡¦with its Danger Goods Safety Management Solution suite of products goes one step further. All the software licenced is web based. This has huge ramifications to an organization:</p>


<p class="margin">1) No need for IT to install software on local hardware<br>


2) No need for IT to update software<br>


3) No need for IT to back up software<br>


4) Users can access the application wherever there is internet access<br>


5) The devices which can execute the solutions can range from a mobile phone, to a tablet to a desktop device, independent of Operating Systems.</p>


<p>The cost savings by almost eliminating IT efforts to install and support an application, more than pays for the licence purchase.</p>

<p>In Summary, Ideabytes½á¡¦web based software is the latest technology that executes on any platform, resulting in significant savings to a company</p>
