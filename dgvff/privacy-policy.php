<li><b>How do we use cookies? </b><br />
Some government websites use cookies. A cookie is a small text file sent from a Web server and placed on your computer&#8217;s hard drive. A cookie is generally used to enhance your browsing experience. You can choose to set your browser to detect and reject cookies, to accept cookies from all sites, or to prompt you whenever a site wants to send you a cookie. Check your browser&#8217;s &#8220;Help&#8221; files to learn how to do this. If you choose to refuse cookies, you may not be able to access some of the interactive features on our websites. Cookies used by the Government of Ontario, do not give us access to anything on your hard drive and cannot do anything to your computer. Cookies used by the Government are encrypted for security purposes to make any information in the cookie unreadable to anyone except the government organization with which you are dealing. Ontario government organizations use two types of cookies: session cookies (temporary) or persistent cookies (longer-term continuing use).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Session cookies may be used to support on-line feedback/discussion, forms and registration and &#8216;e-commerce/shopping cart&#8217; transactions &#8211; they are used only during your online session and expire when you close your browser. Without session cookies, moving around our Web sites could be much slower</li>
<li>Persistent cookies are different from session cookies because they are stored on your computer&#8217;s hard drive for some length of time &#8211; they are usually used if you want us to remember information about your Web preferences (e.g. large font) and passwords for automatic log-in purposes<br />
